Librivox-Search

This is an Angular.js App for searching audiobooks on Librivox.org.
The Search is an author search, which is then filterable by title words.
The app currently has two variants: (1) librivox_search.html which simply displays a filterable list of results, and (2) librivox_search_with_views.html which displays individually selected audiobooks in a separate pane.
